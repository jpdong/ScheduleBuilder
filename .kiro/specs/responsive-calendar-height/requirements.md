# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where the month view calendar on the homepage cannot adapt to different screen heights. Currently, the calendar grid uses fixed heights which prevents it from displaying properly within its container across various screen sizes. The goal is to make the month calendar grid cells dynamically calculate their height based on the available container height, ensuring the entire calendar fits within the viewport.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the calendar on different screen sizes, I want the month calendar to automatically adjust its height to fit within the available container space, so that I can see the complete calendar without scrolling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar container height changes THEN the month grid SHALL recalculate cell heights to fit within the available space
2. WHEN viewing the calendar on mobile devices THEN the calendar SHALL display all 6 weeks within the viewport height
3. WHEN viewing the calendar on desktop THEN the calendar SHALL utilize the available vertical space efficiently
4. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the calendar SHALL dynamically adjust its cell heights in real-time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar cells to maintain proper proportions and readability while adapting to different heights, so that the calendar remains functional and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calendar cells are resized THEN the date numbers SHALL remain clearly visible and properly positioned
2. WHEN calendar cells are resized THEN event items SHALL be displayed appropriately within the available cell space
3. WHEN cells become smaller THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle event overflow with appropriate indicators
4. WHEN cells have sufficient height THEN events SHALL display with full details including time and title

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the responsive calendar height feature to work consistently across all supported browsers and devices, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the calendar on iOS Safari THEN the height adaptation SHALL work correctly with viewport units
2. WHEN using the calendar on Android Chrome THEN the height adaptation SHALL work correctly with viewport units
3. WHEN using the calendar on desktop browsers THEN the height adaptation SHALL work correctly with CSS Grid and Flexbox
4. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the calendar SHALL recalculate heights appropriately
