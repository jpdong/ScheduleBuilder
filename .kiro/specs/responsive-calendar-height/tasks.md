# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create useContainerHeight custom hook
  - Implement ResizeObserver-based height detection hook
  - Add debouncing for resize events to prevent excessive recalculations
  - Include fallback mechanism for browsers without ResizeObserver support
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Update AppleMonthView component with responsive height logic
  - Integrate useContainerHeight hook into AppleMonthView component
  - Calculate dynamic cell heights based on available container space
  - Remove fixed height constraints from month grid CSS
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Enhance CSS Grid system for responsive height
  - Update apple-styles.css to use fractional grid rows instead of fixed heights
  - Implement CSS custom properties for dynamic height values
  - Add viewport-based height calculations for the month view container
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 4. Implement adaptive event display logic
  - Create logic to calculate maximum events per cell based on available height
  - Add event overflow handling with "more" indicators
  - Implement smart event truncation for smaller cell heights
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Add smooth transitions and performance optimizations
  - Implement CSS transitions for height changes during resize
  - Add requestAnimationFrame for smooth visual updates
  - Optimize re-render performance with React.memo and useMemo
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Handle mobile and orientation change scenarios
  - Add specific handling for mobile viewport height calculations
  - Implement orientation change detection and height recalculation
  - Test and fix iOS Safari viewport height issues
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement error boundaries around height calculation logic
  - Add fallback to fixed heights if dynamic calculation fails
  - Handle edge cases like zero-height containers during initial render
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive tests for responsive height functionality
  - Write unit tests for useContainerHeight hook with various container sizes
  - Add integration tests for calendar rendering across different viewport sizes
  - Create visual regression tests for calendar appearance on mobile and desktop
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
